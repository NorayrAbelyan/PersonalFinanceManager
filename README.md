# PersonalFinanceManager
Hey there! I built this Personal Finance Manager as a Java project to show off my programming skills for my portfolio. It’s a command-line app that lets you track your money—adding income and expenses, checking your transaction history, and getting a summary of your finances. I created it to practice Java concepts like OOP and data handling.
